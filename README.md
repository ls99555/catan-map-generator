## Game Rules Implementation

### Base Game Rules
- Standard 19-hex layout for 3-4 players
- Extended layout for 5-6 players
- Proper resource distribution (3 brick, 4 lumber, 4 wool, 4 grain, 3 ore)
- Balanced number placement avoiding adjacent 6s and 8s
- Harbor placement on coastal edges

### Expansion Rules
Each expansion includes:
- **Proper tile distributions** according to official rules
- **Scenario-specific layouts** (islands, rivers, etc.)
- **Special terrain types** (gold fields, fisheries, etc.)
