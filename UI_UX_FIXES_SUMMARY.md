# UI/UX Fixes and Enhancements - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dropdown Visibility
- **Problem**: Dropdown text was too dull and hard to read
- **Solution**: Added `bg-white text-gray-900 font-medium` classes to make text darker and more visible

### 2. Scenario Rules Display
- **Problem**: When scenario was selected, only scenario rules were shown
- **Solution**: Now shows both scenario rules AND base game rules together, with clear separation

### 3. Victory Points Calculation
- **Problem**: Victory points were only calculated for base game vs Cities & Knights
- **Solution**: Added scenario-specific victory point adjustments:
  - Most exploration scenarios: +2 points
  - Pirate/exploration scenarios: +1 point
  - Base scenarios: no adjustment
  - Cities & Knights: maintains 13 points base

### 4. 5-6 Player Map Rendering
- **Problem**: Extension tiles might not be properly displayed
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased viewport padding from 2 to 2.5 layout sizes
  - Added water background around entire map
  - Improved SVG height from 600px to 700px

### 5. Harbor Display
- **Problem**: Harbors were displayed on land tiles instead of at map edges
- **Solution**: 
  - Added water background around map edges
  - Improved harbor icons with house emoji (üè†)
  - Better positioning of harbor text

### 6. Sea Tile Icons
- **Problem**: Sea tiles had unnecessary mountain/sun icons
- **Solution**: Removed the decorative circles from sea tile pattern

### 7. Legend Text Overflow
- **Problem**: Legend text was going past its container
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased legend width from 120px to 140px
  - Increased height from 60px to 70px
  - Shortened text ("High prob" instead of "High probability")
  - Added harbor legend entry

### 8. JSON Export Removal
- **Problem**: JSON export was still available
- **Solution**: Removed JSON export button, keeping only image export

### 9. Fish Resource Logic
- **Problem**: Fish tiles appeared in all Seafarers games
- **Solution**: Fish tiles now only appear in fish-related scenarios:
  - `fishermen-of-catan`
  - `fishermen-lake`
  - `fish-for-catan`

### 10. Balance Score Display
- **Problem**: Percentages in balance score section were hard to read
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `flex-1` to labels for better spacing
  - Added `text-gray-900` and `ml-2` to percentage values
  - Better text contrast and positioning

### 11. Seafarers Configuration
- **Problem**: Seafarers had fish tiles by default
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed fishery tiles from base Seafarers configuration
  - Added fish-related scenarios to supported scenarios list
  - Updated rules to be more accurate to official game
