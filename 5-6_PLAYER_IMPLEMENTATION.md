# Catan Map Generator - 5-6 Player Extension Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of proper 5-6 player extension support in the Catan Map Generator, ensuring complete accuracy with official Catan rules.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Proper 5-6 Player Extension Detection
- **Automatic detection** when player count exceeds 4
- **Visual warnings** showing required game components
- **Accurate component requirements** listing for each expansion

### 2. Enhanced Map Controls
```typescript
// Requires 4 total game boxes for 5-6 players:
// 1. CATAN - The Game (Base Game)
// 2. CATAN - [Expansion Name]
// 3. CATAN - The Game - 5-6 Player Extension
// 4. CATAN - [Expansion Name] - 5-6 Player Extension
```

### 3. Accurate Tile Distribution
- **Base Game**: +6 terrain hexes for 5-6 players (1 of each resource type + 1 desert)
- **Seafarers**: +1 of each land resource + 10 sea hexes + 1 gold field
- **Cities & Knights**: Same as base game distribution
- **Traders & Barbarians**: Same as base game distribution
- **Explorers & Pirates**: No 5-6 player extension available

### 4. Correct Number Token Distribution
- **3-4 Players**: Numbers 3-11 (no 2 or 12)
- **5-6 Players**: Numbers 2-12 (includes rare 2 and 12 tokens)
- **Automatic inclusion** of 2 and 12 when using extensions

### 5. Harbor Adjustments
- **+2 additional generic (3:1) harbors** for 5-6 player games
- **Proper distribution** around larger map layouts

### 6. Special Rules Implementation
- **Special building phase** notification and rules
- **Victory point requirements** remain the same (10 for most, 13 for Cities & Knights)
- **Extension-specific rules** displayed in controls

### 7. Enhanced Statistics Panel
- **Game setup information** showing current configuration
- **Extension status** with visual indicators
- **Component summary** showing what's included
- **Victory point requirements** based on expansion
